# Quiet Editor

Quiet Editor is a distraction-free text editor.

# Running the Editor

Start the editor by running the following command:

    ./editor.py
    
A new web browser window should automatically open to:

    http://localhost:5000/editor/
    
The editor is split into two panes and a command bar. 

* The left pane is where you write your text in markdown format.
* The right pane is where a preview of the rendered markdown is shown.
* The command bar (top, orange when collapsed) lets you run custom commands. Type "help" in the command
 bar for more information.
